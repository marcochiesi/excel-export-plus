EE+ easily exports any post type in an Excel-friendly format. Options: Custom Post Types, fields, meta data, filters, and more.

== Description ==

EE+ allows you to export any type of post data (CPTs included) to excel-friendly formats using an intuitive interface. You have the option to select multiple Post Types, specific fields, meta/custom fields, filter values and split files by number of records.

Supported formats are XLS, XLSx, and CSV.

This plugin is platform agnostic by using the open-source PHPExcel library that generates Microsoft-based files without the need to run on a Windows platform.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I report an issue? =

In the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/excel-export-plus);

= The "Export" is taking too long and generates an error =

This may happen due to memory limitations of your webserver. Unfortunatelly this cannot be bypassed through code and can only be resolved by requesting you webserver to change your memory limits or by turning on the option "Multiple Files" limiting the amount of records within each file.

= Why canÂ´t I export Comments? =

Comments are not yet supported by the plugin. It may be in a future version.
